	<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;">TeachinVietnam.org is a platform designed with the intention of encouraging a more open and direct dialogue between Vietnamese educational organisations, and those individuals with an interest in teaching in the country. It&rsquo;s founding and contributing members are all highly experienced &nbsp;in English teaching, and educational administration in Vietnam, with the site itself a composite reflection upon the culture of the Vietnamese education system. </span></span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;">It provides employers the networking space to advertise vacancies, and for teachers to upload and submit resumes. Furthermore by having broad search criteria it allows for both potential employees and employers to scan the database to find exactly what they are looking for. </span></span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;">Working closely with partners TeachinVietnam.org also supports social, health and educational development causes in impoverished and rural Vietnam. The collective desire to help and assist others is at the epicentre of TeachinVietnam&#39;s agenda, believing that a community of teachers holds at it&#39;s core the value of children, their future and that of the the society that they shall create. In the coming months TeachinVietnam shall be involved in projects in Mounatainous Vietnam, sending aid to children suffering from heart and lung cancers. It welcomes any form of support, you may feel drawn to give.</span></span></p>
