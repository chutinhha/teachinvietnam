My name’s Nguyen Thu Ha. I’m an English teacher at Lien Minh primary school in Vinh Yen town, Vinh Phuc province in Vietnam. Nowadays, there are many websites for learning and teaching English. But since I first visited “Learnenglishkids.org.uk”, I’ve found it’s the most amazing website. Being well designed with abundant resources, the website is useful for not only teachers but also children and parents. My children find it very easy and interesting to learn English through songs, stories and games that are very lively and close to their everyday life. My students have good opportunities to improve all four skills: listening, speaking, reading and writing. Especially, native speakers help them enhance correct and natural pronunciation day by day.The website definitely offers me many benefits. I use resources from the site for my daily lessons to make learning English no more hard or boring but really exciting and attractive. Today I use songs for Warm up, games for Revision, another day I use stories as a reading or listening tasks. Every day, every unit, I take the advantages of the website for my classroom activities  and I believe I have achieved my goal which is that my students more and more love English and they have got remarkable progress.
